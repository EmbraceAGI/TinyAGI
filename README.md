# TinyAGI

This project serves as a backup of the  [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project, with a focus on preserving its elegance and simplicity.

I really appreciate the elegance and simplicity of the BabyAGI project, as it provides an excellent framework. However, over time, it has become increasingly complex. In order to facilitate a better understanding of its principles, I have retained only the core code and removed any irrelevant content, while striving to maintain its simplicity.
